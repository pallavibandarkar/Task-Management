## Authentication & Middleware

- User login/signup handled using JWT tokens
- Token is stored in localStorage for API auth
- Middleware protects task routes and verifies token


## Validations

- **Frontend**: Basic form checks on task creation, login, signup
- **Backend**: Mongoose schema validation ensures required fields
- **Middleware**: Rejects invalid/missing tokens for protected routes


## API Overview

- **User APIs**: Register and login endpoints that return a token on success.
- **Task APIs**: Create, fetch, update, and delete tasks. Token must be included in headers for these.
- **Filters**: Task fetching supports query-based filtering on status and assigned user.
